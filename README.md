# Working of Cathode Ray Tube using Graphics.h Library

![CRT](crt_image.png)

This project demonstrates the working of a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) using the `graphics.h` library in C/C++. It provides a visual representation of how a CRT creates images on the screen by controlling the movement of the electron beam.

## Introduction

The Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) is a fundamental component of old-school computer monitors and televisions. This project aims to illustrate the inner workings of a CRT by simulating the electron beam's motion, its interaction with phosphorescent materials, and how it generates images on the screen.

## Features

- Real-time simulation of the electron beam's movement on the screen.
- Visualization of how pixels are illuminated on the CRT screen.
- Educational tool for understanding the basic principles of CRT operation.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- A C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
- The `graphics.h` library (typically provided by the Turbo C/C++ compiler)
- A Windows-based system (as the `graphics.h` library is primarily used on Windows)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crt-graphics.git
```

2. Make sure you have the `graphics.h` library properly installed on your system.

## How to Use

1. Open the project in your preferred C/C++ IDE.
2. Build and run the project.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the CRT simulation.
4. Observe the electron beam's movement and how it illuminates pixels on the screen.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve this project or add new features, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and test them.
4. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.
